# Chord_Identifier_Max-Js
This patcher uses programming in Max msp and javascript to play a number of notes in a scale in polyphony, the user has to guess the notes input them in and will be told if they are correct or incorrect. 
What works..
The user can determine the notenum()
The user can setScale() by generateScale
The user can playTheNotes() in polyphony

What needs to be fixed
recieveNotes() the number (of the corresponding pitch) will not push() into a dynamic array, so this needs to be addressed for us to compare the notes, for now i am using the console

As always any feedback would be much appreciated
